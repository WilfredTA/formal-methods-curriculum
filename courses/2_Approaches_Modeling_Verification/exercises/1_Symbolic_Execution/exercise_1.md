### **Exercise 1.** Practical Symbolic Execution using Manticore

The purpose of this exercise is to equip you with hand-on experience of applying *existing* symbolic execution tools to analyze smart contracts.
This exercise is based on [Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore)â€”a symbolic execution engine developed in Python by Trail of Bits. *It is also inspired by the Manticore's own [tutorial](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-use-manticore-to-find-smart-contract-bugs/).*

#### **Jupyter Notebook**

The exercise is available as a Jupyter [notebok](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17oyX0mL9TtpjPUQEYO4h_GwyW1A8V8r6?usp=sharing) in Google Colab.

#### **Local Installation**

The exercise requires Python 3.7. Manticore and its dependencies can be installed using `pip`:

`pip install "manticore[native]"`
