#Introduction to the K Framework

As mentioned in chapter 5 the K framework is a semantics framework built for formal reasoning about programming languages. 
The fact that it is so versatile makes it specially important to learn when studying Formal Verification for blockchain development.

It is important to note that it still is in development and has a steep learning curve, although documentation and tutorials are constantly being improved.
