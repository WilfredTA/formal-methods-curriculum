#SMT

Like we mentioned in the chapter introduction "SMT is a generalization of a SAT instance where various sets of variables are replaced by predicates from a variety of underlying theories".
In English this means that SMT is a generalization of SAT to more complex formulas which can involve real numbers, integers, and complex data structures like lists and arrays.

## Installation 

To go through this section we'll be using the Z3 SMT Solver.

Install here:
https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3

Most basic uses of the Z3 prover actually use the Z3 python library for programmatically discharging proofs.
Install it with pip as such:
```
pip install z3-solver
```
