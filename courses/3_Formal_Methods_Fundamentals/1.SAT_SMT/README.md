#SAT & SMT Solving

In this chapter we'll be learning about the SAT problem, how to use SAT solvers, and the theory behind SMT and SMT solvers such as the famous Z3.

Since SMT is a generalization of a SAT instance where various sets of variables are replaced by predicates from a variety of underlying theories we recommend starting by chapter A.SAT and then only when finished going to B.SMT.
