# Hoare Logic

Succintly, "Hoare Logic is a formal system with a set of logical rules for reasoning rigorously about the correctness of computer programs." Proposed by Turing Award winner Tony Hoare in 1969, Hoare Logic was one of the formal systems to be created for reasoning about the correctness of computer programs.

In this chapter we will go over the basics of Hoare Logic, encoding it in Coq, and proving some properties of simple programs.

Folder A provides guidance on Coq.

Folder B teaches how to encode Hoare Logic in Coq and prove program properties with it.
