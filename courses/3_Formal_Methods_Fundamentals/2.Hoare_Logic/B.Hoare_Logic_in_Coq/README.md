# Hoare Logic in Coq

## Tutorial

Building on top of the previous section we now learn how to formalize Hoare Logic in Coq and prove properties with it.

Fortunately the amazing book we used in the last section has a volume 2 just for this, also with solved exercises!

The link to "Software Foundations Volume 2: Programming Language Foundations" can be found here:

We recommend going at least through to section "Type Systems". Material after this chapter is not related to Hoare Logic (but is still *very* interesting and if you find the time we recommend studying it as well).
