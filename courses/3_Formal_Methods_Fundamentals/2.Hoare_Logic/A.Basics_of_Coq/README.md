## Tutorial

The book "Software Foundations Volume 1: Logical Foundations" focuses on how to use Coq to formalize programs and their precise semantics.
It is open-source and an excelent starting point for students with zero background knowledge on how to use interactive theorem provers.

Every chapter is accompanied by theory and solved exercises. 
We highly recommend going through all the theory in the book as well as solving the exercises before advancing to section B.

Chapters after (including) "Extracting OCaml from Coq" are not fundamental and can be skipped.
