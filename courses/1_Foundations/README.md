# Course 1: Foundations

This course focuses on the mathematic topics that are important to master *regardless* of one's focus; if you plan to work with formal verification in any domain (blockchain or otherwise), you will need to understand the material covered in this course.

# Overview

We will cover the following topics:
1. Propositional Logic
2. Predicate Logic
3. Set Theory
4. Equational Reasoning & Term Rewriting
5. Decision Procedures
6. Important meta-logical concepts

# Exercises & Tools

Throughout this course, we provide exercises using a variety of media. Some exercises will be purely "on-paper proofs". Others will expose you to various formal tools, such as SAT/SMT solvers, a formal modeling & proof tool using rewrite logic (K Framework), as well as a general-purpose proof assistant that provides a language for mechanically-checkable proofs in natural-deduction (Athena). If any of the terminology above is foreign to you, that's perfectly fine. In fact, it's a good sign; you're in the right place to remedy that knowledge gap.

All tools used in this course are provided in the top-level `tools` directory as git submodules. Each tool is containerized using Docker so that you don't need to worry about setup and configuration. Instructions for using each tool are located in their respective `README.md` files.
